	lib-jitsi-meet
	- New features:
		- Apply max bitrates on video sender (#1275)
		- PerformanceObserverStats initial commit Add a performance stat around long tasks. Chrome supports PerformanceObserver API that lets us register for long tasks event. Any task that takes longer than 50ms is considered a long task.
		- feat(prejoin): Expose method to make a precall test

	- Fixes:
		- Fixes setting non moderators to members when lobby is enabled.
		- fix(video-quality): add missing simulcast stream constraints When the client starts video muted and the track is later added, make sure we construct the simulcasr stream constraints then.
		- fix(video-quality): Get downsampled video for p2p case When the video sender constraint changes in the p2p case when the remote user switches between stage/tile view, get a downsampled video of the original 720p stream instead of requesting the camera for a new stream with the lower resolution. Fixes https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/7267
		- fix(video-quality): add a check for local video track before applying max bitrates
		- Fix unit tests for PerformanceObserverStats
		- Scale remote audio levels reported on receiver to getStats levels The audio levels reported on the audio receivers are lower when compared to the value reported by getStats. Values reported by getStats on chrome do not follow the the spec and since we have combination of clients using both getStats and getSynchronizationSources, lets stick to one scale to make them look uniform. Also, the receivers seem to be reporting audio level for a little bit after the remote user has muted. Make sure the track is unmuted before setting the audio level on the track.
