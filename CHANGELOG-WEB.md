		- fix(TPC): Use addTrack instead of addStream in Unified-plan impl.
		- fix(RTC) drop the "old gUM" flow
		- fix(SDP): Move all SDP related files to a different dir. SDP utility classes are spread across RTC and XMPP directories now, moving these class files to a 'sdp' directory.
		- fix(stats): Return promise for getStats. Switch to returning a Promise for getStats. Reset frame rate stat to 0 when video is suspended as a result of endpoint falling out of last-n.
		- sysMessageHandler not deleted (#1590)
		- fix(quality-control): Send the new constraint on join. Fixes the case where the old format height constraint is sent on join for a jvb media session.
		- fix(quality-control): Switch to new receiver constraints by default. Use the new receiver constraints unless it is explicitly disabled through config.js.
		- Drops the sys message handler after used or connected.
		- fix(RTC): Specify default width of 1280px for video. Fixes https://github.com/jitsi/lib-jitsi-meet/issues/1571.
		- fix(ReceiverVideoController): Cache the new receiver constraints.
		- fix(screenshare): Disable SS simulcast based on fps requested. Disable simulcast for low fps screenshare and enable it for high fps screenshare. testing.capScreenshareBitrate config.js setting has now been deprecated.
		- Fixes sending initial disco info on attaching connection.
		- high CPU on Chrome with low fps screen sharing (#1570)
		- fix(JingleSession): Increase the ICE candidate gathering timeout to 150ms. This will reduce the numbers of transport-info IQs sent by the client.
		- fix(TPC): Fix error handling for getStats.
		- fix(stats): Use promise-based getStats on all browsers. Get rid of the browser specific keys and use the standard spec-compliant fields for stats. Get the resolution/fps for remote streams from 'inbound-rtp' stats. Use the 'track' stats for the local resolution/fps since these take the active simulcast streams into account.
		- fix(SS): Implement a 2500Kbps limit for VP9 SS.
		- fix(RTC): Remove stream effect before disposing the track. Remove the effect instead of stopping it so that the original stream is restored on both the local track and on the peerconnection.

	lib-jitsi-meet
	- New features:
		- feat(RTC): Signal video type and availability to bridge.
		- feat(stats): Add a new bridge message "EndpointStats" for stats. Use the new Colibri message "EndpointStats" for broadcasting the local stats. The bridge then will be able to filter the endpoint stats and send them only to the interested parties instead of broadcasting it to all the endpoints in the call.
		- feat(e2ee): makes olm sessions initialisation lazy
		- feat(e2ee) update to SFrame draft -02
		- feat(stats): Get audio levels for the top 5 speakers only.
		- Consider absence of A/V muted from presence as muted.
		- Moderator can revoke moderator role to others and himself (#1532)
		- participant kick reason add
		- feat(jwtError): Send explicit error on auth failed with invalid jwt
		- Remove ssrcs on leave
		- feat(ReceiveVideoController): Add the ability to send constraints in the new format. Add the ability to send the bridge messages for the receiver video constraints in the new format directly.
		- feat(dominantSpeaker): Add previous speaker list.
		- feat(browser-support): Add support for WKWebview based browsers. Apple added getUserMedia support for WkWebview based browsers like chrome and Firefox on iOS 14.3. These browsers behave as Safari does on iOS. Therefore, extend the Safari checks to these webkit based browsers as well.
		- Added mute video moderation feature (#1496)
		- Use the new bridge signaling format.
		- Reuse billingId from localstorage as jitsiMeetId.
		- feat(docs) mvoe API documentatrion to the handbook
		- feat(GUM): timeout.
		- Send billing id to prosody on join presence
		- Add the ability to configure max. bitrates for VP9. The max bitrate for VP9 is enforced by adding the b=AS:<limit> line in the SDP since there is no way to configure the max. bitrates for the individual SVC streams using RTCRtpSender.setParameters.
		- expose MEETING_ID_SET event (#1484)
		- Adds option to set ws keepalive url through config.
		- Implement aggresive layer suspension on RN. RN doesn't support RTCRtpSender yet. Therefore, media is suspended on RN by changing the media direction in the SDP whenever the client receives an ideal height of 0 for sender constraints on the bridge channel.
		- Support the urn:xmpp:extdisco:2 namespace specified by XEP-0215 (#1472)
		- Changes ws default keepalive interval.
		- Detects shard changed when using websockets. (#1462)
		- Add codec selection mechanism. Determine the preferred codec for a given endpoint based on the config.js settings and the codecs supported by the endpoint. The preferred codec is published in presence and then used by the other endpoints in the call during join/leave to determine if the codec needs to be changed on the fly. Different codecs can be configuered for p2p/jvb connections. The preferredCodec/disabledCodec settings under videoQuality will have precedence over the older settins like preferH264/disableH264.

	- Fixes:
		- fix(rtc) Fix setting effects while not in a conference.
		- Fixes error for undefined error, on happening on p2p kick.
		- fix(receiveVideoController): Do a deep copy of constraints for comparsion.
		- fix(codec-selection): Fix codec selection for unified plan browsers.
		- fix(receiveVideoController): Do not send redundant video constraints to the bridge.
		- fix(e2ee) update docs after dropping signatures
		- Dial-out after setting password in the meeting.
		- fix(caps): features update event is not emitted.
		- fix(TPC): get ssrc info per ssrc and not per mline.
		- fix(JingleSession): Avoid renegotiation when user with no sources leaves the call.
		- fix(deps) update webrtc-adapter to v7.7.1
		- fix(screenshare): audio screen share muted state
		- fix(modificationQueue): error handling & logs
		- fix(lastN): Return the correct lastN value for the conference.
		- fix(conference): Do not signal muted tracks on join. Do not add the muted audio/video tracks to the peerconnection on join. The tracks will be added when the user unmutes for the first time. This reduces the number of remote sources that will be added when a participant joins a large call where everyone joins muted (startAudioMuted/startVideoMuted setting).
		- Checks presence editing and make sure we send only on change.
		- fix(RTCUtils): Init availableDevices.
		- fix(RTC) fix device selection not being available
		- fix(TPCUtils): undefined is not an object (evaluating 'this.tpcUtils.replaceTrack(e,t).then')
		- fix(TPC): Remove the existing track instead of overwriting. When a second remote track of the same mediatype is received for an endpoint, remove the existing track before creating the new remote track.
		- fix(e2ee) fix disabling E2EE
		- fix(e2ee) fix key index after ratchetting
		- Drop caps handling (#1495)
		- fix(SendVideoController): Apply the sender constraint only when it changes. There were cases where the bridge was sending the same constraint multiple times causing redundant calls to getParameters/setParameters on the RTCRtpSender.
		- fix(gum) update permissions prompt detection
		- Save guards _features to be always empty and nver undefined. (#1493)
		- fix(GUM-permissions): cache permissions on init.
		- fix(example) simplify
		- fix(GUM): improve permissions logic.
		- fix(ice-restart): Force client reloads when call is migrated.

		- fix(avatar) revert back to defaulting to Gravatar
		- fix(lastN): select screenshare endpoint always when auto pinning. When trying to auto pin screenshare, always select the endpoint even though it happens to be the large video participant in redux. The auto pin screenshare logic kicks in after the track is added.  If the screenshare endpoint is not among the forwarded endpoints from the bridge, it needs to be selected again.
		- fix(lastN): Do not override channelLastN value. If limitLastN values are specified and channelLastN < limitLastN, configure channelLastN on the conference.
		- Fixes 404 page link when base is used.

		- fix(safari): Ensure simulcast stream resolutions don't change. Safari 14.1 has a bug where it returns 720p for every simulcast stream when RTCRtpSender.getParameters is called even though the stream resolutions are different. By using the encodings config used when source was added, on every RTCRtpSender.setParameters call, we ensure that simulcast stream resolutions don't change. chore(deps) lib-jitsi-meet@latest

		- fix(CalendarList): calendar.svg path.
		- fix(screenshare): Fixes for the blurry desktop share issues. Do not resize the desktop share to 720p by default when the desktop track resolution is higher than 720p. This is causing bluriness when presenter is turned on. Remove the 'detail' contentHint setting for the desktop+presenter canvas stream as it forcing chrome to send only 5 fps stream for high resolution desktop tracks. Move the desktop resizing logic behind a config.js option - videoQuality.resizeDesktopForPresenter.

		- fix(video-quality): set lastN to 1 when screenshare is added to call in audio-only mode. This fixes an issue where lastN is not bumped to 1 on an audio-only client when a screenshare source is added to the call.
		- fix(deviceChange):Dont create video track if muted
		- fix(conference): start muted values on initial GUM
		- fix(iFrame): capturScreenshot - check if the remote participant has a track attached. Participants that join video muted do not have video tracks attached. Fixes https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/7942.

		- fix(UI): Do not re-compute the container width when chat window is closed. Since the external API now sets preferredWidth/preferredHeight for resizing the large video, we don't need to add chat width to the computed window width when the chat window is closed. Fixes https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/7889
		- fix(pwa) improve upon pwa specs
		- fix(avatars) refactor preloading

		- * languages-ka.json
		- Update Arabic translation
		- * lang:New translation malayalam(ml-in)


	lib-jitsi-meet
	- New features:
		- Skip p2p when the participant is jigasi.
		- feat(stats) migrate RN to new stats
		- Add option to force pc to use turn relay candidates.
		- Remove the min-participants config. (#1418)
		- Log the jvb version. (#1410)
		- feat(BrowserCapabilities) drop supportsVideo
		- feat(RTC) bump minimum supported Chromium version to 72
		- Reduce pings and adds xmpp ping config (#1389)
		- feat(rn) support getDisplayMedia
		- feat(twa) add TWA check function
		- feat(e2ee) log Olm version

	- Fixes:
		- fix(stats) fix parsing codec in new stats
		- Skip sending multiple times disco-info to jicofo.
		- Maybe start p2p only when we have received all presences.
		- Implement the encodings workaround only on Safari. Explicitly check if all the encodings report the same scaleResolutionDownBy value before trying to ensure they match the expected values. This makes Chrome VP9 work again.
		- Fixes ping options usage.
		- fix(XMPP): Get the correct domain for XMPP ping.
		- Updates ping logic around detecting xmpp activity.
		- add `getParticipants` to JitsiConference docs
		- Always query the main domain for features. Fixes jitsi/jitsi-meet#8173 (#1428)
		- fix(TPC): Do not scale down desktop track in p2p mdoe.
		- fix(deps) update logger to 1.0.0
		- fix(last-n): Do not let Jicofo initialize last-n for the whole conference. The plan is to move the lastNLimits logic to bridge. The clients will be able to override(lower) the bridge limits through the bridge channel only. Also, this lets us configure last-n per receiver and not set the last-n value for the whole conference the way Jicofo sets it currently.
		- fix(TPC): do not update encodings for simulcast desktop tracks. Fixes https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/8094.
		- typos
		- typos on comments
		- fix(TPC): Do not update encodings for non-simulcast sources.
		- fix(TPC): Ensure encodings resolutions match configured values. On every call to RTCRtpSender.setParameters(), ensure that the resolution configured for the encoding matches that of the value configured on the RTCRtpSender when the source was added to the peerconnection. This should prevent us from overriding the default values if the browser returns erroneous values when RTCRtpSender.getParameters is used for getting the encodings info. This fixes the issue on recent versions of Safari where the 'scaleResolutionDownBy' value comes back as 1 for all encodings even though the encoding resolution is different from the stream capture resolution.
		- fix(video-quality): Fix p2p desktop share quality. In p2p mode, 'scaleResolutionDownBy' is used for downscaling a stream when needed, i.e. when the user receives a receive constraint of 360p because the other participant is in tile view. When desktop share is started, the encoding config has to be scaled back up so that the other participant starts receiving HD resolution for the share as desktop shares are autopinned. Therefore, encodings have to enabled/disabled for desktop shares as well. Earlier it was done only for camera tracks.
		- fix(stun) update default list of STUN servers
		- fix(rn) release audioVideo stream after creating new MediaStream
		- fix(audio-recorder) remove no longer needed code
		- fix(RTC): Fix log formatting
		- fix(video-quality): do not disable encodings when sender constraints are not configured on the conference. Fixes https://github.com/jitsi/lib-jitsi-meet/issues/1333 in applications that use lib-jitsi-meet and do not have layer suspension enabled.
		- Add the x-google-conference flag on RD when screensharing. Add the conference flag back since the bridge is able to handle the case where more than 1 temporal layers are received even when only 1 ssrc is signaled.
		- fix(xmpp): Update previd value when trying to resume connection.
		- fix(JingleSession) log initialization error

- [jicofo 1.0-690](https://github.com/jitsi/jicofo/releases/tag/stable%2Fjitsi-meet_5390)

		- fix(native) add missing function
		- Show focus indicator only when navigating via keyboard
		- fix(video-quality): Add the ability to request Ultra HD resolutions Change the preferredVideoQuality and maxReceiverVideoQuality values to Ultra HD resolutions. The requested resolution can be as high as 4K to facilitate VPaaS customers to request 4K. The sender video resolution will always max out at the value specified in the video constraints from config.js settings.
		- fix(misc) update update-ljm script commit message
		- fix(config) drop useStunTurn
		- fix(android) - separates the invocation of the gradle tasks. It was noticed on some configurations that the publish task was executed before assembleRelease finished
		- fix(android) - adds the import for the VersionName, since on some configurations it is not automatically imported
		- Makes the code more defensive to prevent an error. (#7837)

		- fix(lang) add basic support for serbian
		- fix(rn,config) increase config load timeout to 10 seconds

	- Fixes:
		- fix(TPC): maxBitratesVideo break screenshare
		- fix(e2ee) add more documentation
		- fix(updateDevices): On enumerateDevices.
		- fix(audio-levels): Reset audio level to 0 when remote user is muted. When using getSynchornizationSources on the audio receiver to gather audio levels for remote tracks, browser reports last known audio levels even when the remote user is audio muted, we need to reset the value to zero here so that the audio levels are cleared.
		- fix(safari): Remove old remote tracks when a new track is received for an endpoint. On Safari, MediaStream.onremovetrack is not fired when a remote desciption with a removed MSID is applied. As a result, new remote tracks for the same endpoint are not created causing issues where the video is not updated on Safari. Also, make sure local tracks on pc are updated when devices are changed while the user is in muted state.
		- Disable RTX on Firefox. Disable RTX on FF as we are seeing video freezes on FF80 and later - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1668028

	- Fixes:
		- fix(mediaDeviceHelper): fix typo in dispatch

		- Fixes setting non moderators to members when lobby is enabled.
		- fix(video-quality): add missing simulcast stream constraints When the client starts video muted and the track is later added, make sure we construct the simulcasr stream constraints then.
		- fix(video-quality): Get downsampled video for p2p case When the video sender constraint changes in the p2p case when the remote user switches between stage/tile view, get a downsampled video of the original 720p stream instead of requesting the camera for a new stream with the lower resolution.

		- fix(video-quality): add a check for local video track before applying max bitrates
		- Fix unit tests for PerformanceObserverStats
		- Scale remote audio levels reported on receiver to getStats levels The audio levels reported on the audio receivers are lower when compared to the value reported by getStats. Values reported by getStats on chrome do not follow the the spec and since we have combination of clients using both getStats and getSynchronizationSources, lets stick to one scale to make them look uniform. Also, the receivers seem to be reporting audio level for a little bit after the remote user has muted. Make sure the track is unmuted before setting the audio level on the track.
