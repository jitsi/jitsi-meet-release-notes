##  2.0.8218 (2023-01-13)
- [jitsi-meet 1.0.6918](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/releases/tag/stable%2Fjitsi-meet_8218)
	- New features:
		- feat(rn,deps) update react-native-webrtc to 106.0.3
		- feat(polls): added marginTop
		- feat(share-room): created getInviteOthersControl helper (#12769)
		- feat(rn,deps) update react-native-webrtc to 106.0.2
		- feat(share-room): disable Invite Others button when Share is visible (#12765)
		- feat(ui/polls/security/native): style fixes and updates  (#12761)
		- Append ?room= to conferenceRequestUrl. (#12753)
		- feat(android) created Monochrome Icon
		- feat(base/media): SS mobile align (#12743)

	- Fixes:
		- Drops jicofo-authuser as we use hardcoded value.
		- Fix appending URL params. (#12763)
		- fix(deeplinking) Consider deprecated config (#12758)
		- fix(audio-only) Fix an issue where 'startAudioOnly' in config is not applied to web clients.
		- fix(local-rec) Stop recording properly on size exceeded (#12757)
		- Fixes using s2s for visitors.


	lib-jitsi-meet
	- New features:

	- Fixes:
		- Fix setting machineUid when sending conference-request.
		- fix(quality-control) Fix receiver constraints for default case. When the application doesn't set receiver constraints, generate default constraints in the source-name mode. Cleanup code related to the endpoint based video constraint handling for p2p connection.
		- fix(qualitycontrol): Cleanup old receiver constraints. Endpoint based receiver constraints and other endpoint based bridge signaling messages are no longer supported by latest JVB after the switch to source-name signaling. Rename method names 'sendNewReceiverVideoConstraintsMessage'->'sendReceiverVideoConstraintsMessage', 'setNewReceiverVideoConstraints'->'setReceiverVideoConstraints'
		- fix(JitsiTrack) Add setSourceName/getSourceName methods to JitsiTrack class.
		- fix(p2p) Fix an issue where unmute fails on p2p with channelLastN=0. Always initiate a sRD->cA->sLD cycle since renegotiation fails in the following scenario. In a p2p call when channelLastN=0, the direction on the video tranceiver is set to'inactive'. At this point, if the user unmutes, the track is replaced on the video sender. If a cO->sLD->sRD is triggered, the browser adds a third m-line which isn't expected and possibly is a bug. All renegotiations fail as a result. However, the browser does not add a third m-line in the answer it generates and renegotiation succeeds.
		- fix(BridgeChannel) skip close notification if the code is 1001

##  2.0.8194 (2023-01-12)
- [jitsi-meet 1.0.6897](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/releases/tag/stable%2Fjitsi-meet_8194)
	- New features:

		- fix(invite-dialog) adjust dial in limit display condition and styling (#12654)
		- fix(conference) Fixes an issue where first unmute with disableInitialGUM=true was resulting in user staying muted. When device list changes, create a new track with the preferred device only if the user is unmuted. If the user is audio/video muted, remove the existing track from conference. A new track will be created and replaced automatically when the user unmutes. Also since screensharing is a separate source, always check for updated camera devices.

	lib-jitsi-meet
	- New features:
		- feat(multi-stream) Enable multi-stream by default (if not disabled explicitly) (#2116)
		- Handle dominant speaker silence.
		- feat(build) embed jquery slim
		- feat(JitsiConference) added end conference

	- Fixes:
		- fix(multi-stream) Block addition of multiple video streams of the same videoType. This fixes an issue where mute camera operation doesn't stop sending camera stream even though locally it appears to the user that they are muted. This happens when multiple camera streams are added to peerconnection because of how toggle of the video button is implemented. This limitation will be removed when the application is fixed.
		- fix(TPC): Ignore stopped transceivers on FF during new track addition. Firefox lists stopped transceivers when getTranceivers is called, ignore these when picking a trancceiver for a screenshare track. Fixes an issue when starting screenshare fails if there are stopped tranceivers in the peerconnection (i.e., if some remote users with sources have left the call).
		- fix(e2ee) discards frames that cannot be decrypted
		- fix(TPCUtils): Re-use the existing recv-only transceiver for secondary video tracks. Fixes cases where SS fails in multi-stream mode with p2p->jvb->p2p switching.
		- fix(TPC) Do not force immediate O/A cycles after track replace operations. In Unified-plan mode, we rely on the browser to fire 'negotiationneeded' event to start a O/A cycle. Also add muted tracks to PC. Fixes issues where the streams are not being signaled when call switches over from p2p to jvb in multi-stream mode.
		- fix(ts) skip generating type definitions for index.js
		- fix(stats): Skip bandwidth calc if there is no uplink/downlink bitrate. This fixes an error that gets logged when no media is being sent/received by the endpoint. Logger.js:154 2022-09-12T14:40:53.476Z [modules/statistics/AvgRTPStatsReporter.js] <xl.addNext>:  bandwidth_upload - invalid value for idx: 0
		- fix(SignalingLayer) sync interface with implementation
		- fix(ProxyConnectionPC) use a custom signaling layer implementation
		- fix(build) add missed jquery slim imports
		- fix(logging) Do not print 'Fowarded sources changed' log multiple times.
		- fix(TPC): Switch media direction correctly on all m-lines associated with local tracks during p2p->jvb switch. Fixes cases where SS stream is not being sent when p2p->jvb switch happens.
		- fix(ProxyConnection) add more necessary stubs
		- fix(SignalingLayer) add sourceName argument to getPeerMediaInfo
		- fix(connectivity): Fire trackStreaming status update  on init. > Possibly fixes a bug where SS appears black when the'unmute' and forwarded sources event for the track are received before a large-video update is scheduled.
		- fix(electron):Respect desktopSharingSources option
		- fix(types) update hand-crafted types
		- fix(chore) xmpp constants jsdoc

		- feat(RTC) drop no longer supported PC media constraints
		- Updates deployment info key for release and push to analytics.
		- Handles release number coming from backend.
		- Adds a flag runInLiteMode useful for testing.

	- Fixes:
		- fix(SignalingLayer): Skip checking for last presence if the client doesn't join muc.
		- fix(TPC) Stop munging remote desc for imploding the SIM groups. Jicofo by default now strips the simulcast SSRCs and sends only the primary SSRC and RTX to all the receiving endpoints in the call. Therefore remote SDP munging is not required on the clients anymore.
		- fix(presense) don't lose prev presenceChanged value
		- fix(docs) improve documentation that jwt works on websocket
		- fix(JitsiConference) log a warning instead of an error is p2p fails
		- fix(types) remove setSuspendVideo declaration
		- fix(docs) Added docs on how to define tokens (#2018)

		- fix(RTC): Add function declaration to JitsiTrack. RN clients throw a function undefined error otherwise.
		- fix(device-change): enable on iOS Safari < 15.4
		- fix(SDP): Reset sources to MSID map for plan-b clients. When source-name signaling is enabbled on plan-b clients, the sources to MSID map needs to be cleared after every transformation since browser in plan-b mode produces a new set of SSRCs and trackID when a track is removed and new track is added to the peerconnection. This fixes an issue where the track index in the source-name gets incremented after a track replace operation.

	- New features:

		- feat(ts) typescript conversion of MediaDirection
		- feat(ts) convert service/statistics/constants to typescript

	- Fixes:
		- Cleanups JitsiConference on reservation and max user failures.  @damencho (#1986)
		- fix(video-quality) Update frame heights in content-modify for p2p. (#1983)
		- fix(BridgeChannel): re-send constraints and videoType message after every re-connect. This fixes an issue where the receiver constraints and video type messages are sent on the bridge channel only the first time the ws conn gets re-established.
		- p2p reject reason (#1840)
		- fix(presence) Only apply default videoType on video tracks
		- fix(presence): send presence update when a local track is removed. When a screenshare track is removed in the legacy mode, presence needs to be sent with the muted state and videoType so the remote gets updated.
		- fix(presence) Parse peer presence in legacy format correctly. When source-name signaling is enabled, get correct peermedia info when the peer sends presence in the legacy format. This fixes an issue where Jigasi users cannot be heard by endpoints that have source-name signaling enabled.
		- fix(BreakoutRooms) fix checking for isBreakoutRoom early
		- fix(multi-stream) fix p2p issues with secondary video sources.
		- fix(SDP) fix unit test for LocalSdpMunger.
		- fix(conference) Disable p2p between eps running in different SDP modes. Disable p2p between endpoints that are not running in the same SDP mode. The source-add/source-remove handlers assume the mids to follow the same pattern on both self and peer but the mids generated in plan-b mode are different from unified plan mode. Fixes https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/11100.
		- fix(multi-stream) Update the <ssrc, source-name> map for p2p as well.
		- fix(SDP) Always modify the streamId part of msid when source-name signaling enabled. Do this even if the browser provides a non '-' string for streamId since we rely on this to generate the source name.
		- Set affiliation. (#1966)
		- fix(multi-stream) Handle source-name based presence updates. Handle presence updates for multiple sources per remote endpoint.
		- fix(multi-stream) Add default presence for camera tracks in source-name signaling. Also switch to using signalingLayer.getPeerSourceInfo during remote track creation when source-name signaling is used.
		- fix(multi-stream) Reject m-lines associated with removed sources. We do not want the client to re-use the inactive transceivers that are associated with m-lines for removed remote tracks. Rejecting a m-line on source-remove clears it from the list of available transceivers.
		- fix(SDP) Extract the stream id from msid for source-name generation.
		- fix(multi-stream) Do not init ParticipantConnectionStatusHandler when source-name signaling is enabled.
		- fix(TPC) Send presence before signaling for SS tracks. This is needed for the track to be identified as a desktop track on the remote peer when the JitsiRemoteTrack is created. Fixes https://github.com/jitsi/lib-jitsi-meet/issues/1649.
		- fix(multi-stream) Add video tracks sequencially. If there are more than one video track at pc creation time, add them sequencially to avoid renegotiation loop.
		- fix(TPC) Update the local SSRC cache when a track is replace with another. Fixes an issue where the local stats are not emitted in Unified plan after a track replace.
		- fix(multi-stream) Check if the flags config options is defined.
		- fix(multi-stream-support) Support muting of desktop track.
		- fix(build) use path.join in webpack-shared.config
		- fix(build,ts) clean before building

		- fix(screenshare) Add and then mute the camera track after SS stops instead of not adding the track. This is a follow up for https://github.com/jitsi/lib-jitsi-meet/pull/1944.

		- Adds a property to JitsiParticipant is hidden from recorder. (#1889)
		- feat(multi-stream-support) Adjust presence and videoType bridge message. (#1887)
		- feat(multi-stream-support) Configure the senders based on SenderVideoConstraintsV2. The encodings for local video tracks are confiugured based on the SenderVideoConstraintsV2 constraints received from the bridge. The constraints are sourceName based. Also ignore enableLayerSuspension flag since it has been deprecated and layer suspension has been enabled by default. Also having it off makes screensharing on Chrome in unified plan not work as expected.
		- feat(multi-stream-support) Add the support for multiple local video streams.
		- feat(lobby): lobby chat messaging
		- feat(multi-stream-support) Handle SDP munging for multiple local/remote streams per ep. (#1868)
		- feat(multi-stream-support) Do not assume a single local or remote track/mediaType.
		- feat(build) don't build library on postinstall

	- Fixes:
		- fix(TPC) Avoid renegotiations for p2p for mute/unmute.
		- fix(TPC) Do not force renegotiations for p2p. Chrome doesn't render media when the SSRC is added back to the m-line after removing it because of source-remove->source-add from peer. Avoid renegotiations so that these source removes and adds are not sent to the peer after the track is replaced.
		- fix(JingleSessionPC) Remove the ssrc lines in remote desc sdp on source removal. In P2P and unified mode, Chrome does not render the media if an SSRC is removed and the same one is added back (happens when the sender is camera muted->starts SS->stops SS->turns camera on). That is why SSRC was not being removed. However, mobile endpoints that are running in plan-b generate a new SSRC when the client switches between camera and screenshare. This will cause issues on a p2p receiver that is running in unified mode. Fixes https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/11010.
		- fix(TPCUtils): Check for the track mute state before looking up the transceiver. This fixes an issue where replaceTrack fails when a muted track is being replaced with another track in Unified plan.
		- fix(ts) clean-up TS tests where conversion is complete
		- fix(JitsiConference) fix exceptions which occur after leaving the conference
		- fix(rtc) reject getUserMedia with JitsiTrackError
		- fix(doc) update building
		- fix(JingleSessionPC) Do not recycle m-lines when sources leave and join. Recycling the m-line by rejecting it and then re-using is causing issues where sometimes the track addition fails. When a new ssrc is added to an m-line that was rejected and port is changed back to the default port, sometimes the remote sdp returned by browser wouldn't contain the newly added ssrcs and the track addition fails as a result. Error: No SSRC lines found in remote SDP for remote stream[msid=854882f8-audio-1,type=audio]     at Ca._remoteTrackAdded (https://web-cdn.jitsi.net/meetjitsi_5885.2601/libs/lib-jitsi-meet.min.js?v=5885.2601:2:439103)     at Ca._usesUnifiedPlan.onTrack (https://web-cdn.jitsi.net/meetjitsi_5885.2601/libs/lib-jitsi-meet.min.js?v=5885.2601:2:432207)     at RTCPeerConnection.r (https://web-cdn.jitsi.net/meetjitsi_5885.2601/libs/lib-jitsi-meet.min.js?v=5885.2601:2:680736) .
		- fix(rn,JingleSessionPC) remove aggressive layer suspension in RN
		- realDeviceId match by label and deviceId (#1919)
		- fix(JingleSessionPC) fix "echo" on mobile
		- fix(qualitycontrol) SenderVideoConstraintsV2 changed to SenderSourceConstraints. The colibri class name for the source name sender constraints changed from SenderVideoConstraintsV2 to SenderSourceConstraints. The new format is {colibriClass: 'SenderSourceConstraints', sourceName: 'b6746083-v0', maxHeight: 180}
		- fix(presence) Change the default videoType assumed in presence to camera. The client doesn't add videoType to presence if the videoType is CAMERA since it is the default type. Fixes https://github.com/jitsi/lib-jitsi-meet/issues/1649
		- fix(quality-control) Configure encodings for all sources on media session creation. When multi-stream-support is enabled, configure the encodings on all the local video sources.
		- fix(qualitycontrol) Throw errors if sourceName is missing in constraints when multi-stream-support is enabled. Also, configure all the video tracks when the user changes the quality settings from UI.
		- Cleans up rooms after failure to join.
		- Adds missing ts files.
		- Adds missing checks for clean repo.
		- fix(TPC) add muted tracks if p2p is disabled (fix #1851)
		- fix(JingleSessionPC) Do not force track removal at pc level on user leave. When a user leaves, the ssrcs associated with the ep are removed from the remote description and a renegotiation is forced. The browser then fires 'removetrack' event on the associated MediaStream when sRD is called with ssrcs removed. The remote track is then disposed of in the event handler. Therefore, there is no need to delete the tracks at the TPC level before renegotiation. This also prevents the 'Removed track not found for stream' events from showing up in the browser console log.

	- Translation updates:
		- Update of the translation to portuguese language (#9432)
		- Update of the translation to portuguese language (#9392)


	lib-jitsi-meet
	- New features:
		- feat(transcribing): configurable transcription language
		- feat(non-participant-messages) Add a new JitiConferenceEvent for messages ignored by ENDPOINT_MESSAGE_RECEIVED
		- feat(BridgeChannel): Signal a new videoType for high fps screenshare. This lets the bridge adjust the bitrate allocation for this source so that layers with higher fps are prioritized over layers with higher resolution. As a result, endpoints with restricted downlink will receive a high fps low resolution share as opposed to a high resolution low fps screenshare.
		- feat(JingleSessionPC): Enable unfied plan by default for chrome p2p.
		- Switch to unified plan on chrome by default unless explicitly disabled.
		- feat(RTC): Add the ability to change desktop share fps. Provide a method for changing the capture fps for desktop tracks during the call. These changes to the lib are needed for making it configurable from the UI.
		- feat(replace-participant): Replace participant with same jwt in the conf

	- Fixes:
		- fix(ProxyConnection) add new required stubs
		- fix(tpc) fix extracting ssrc map when using single stream
		- fix(transcribing): send transcripton_language only when necessary (#1677)
		- Fix av moderation n.filter is not a function.
		- fix(ConnectionQuality): Do not show red/yellow GSM bars on join. When the user first unmutes their video, the connection quality is shown as poor until the local stats are available. Calculate the connection quality only after the stats are available, i.e., assume 100% until pcStatsInterval has elapsed.
		- fix(precall) respect custom callstats script url for precall test
		- fix(log) lower severity of overly verbose logs (2)
		- fix(log) lower severity of overly verbose logs
		- fix(JingleSessionPC): Fix startMuted cases for p2p unified plan. Chrome doesn't create a decoder for ssrc in the remote description when there is no local source and the endpoint is offerer. Initiating a renegotiation with the endpoint as a responder fixes this issue. Add a workaround until Chrome fixes this bug.
		- Missed SSRCs in Unified Plan with several "ssrc-group:FID" groups. (#1658)
		- fix(TPC): Fix the screenshare issue when user starts video muted on chrome. Munge 3 ssrcs in the SDP for chrome in unified plan always for the simulcast case.
		- fix(JingleSessionPC): Disable unified-plan for p2p chrome. Do not enable unified plan for p2p chrome by default until StartMutedTest is fixed. Fix media direction for case when there are no local and remote sources, should be set to 'inactive' in that case.
		- fix(codec-selection): Fix VP9 codec switching issue in Chrome unified-plan. Munge only the m-line that corresponds to the source that the browser will be sending. Do not select VP9 on Firefox. Detect support for RTCRtpTransceiver#setCodecPreferences correctly.
		- fix(RTC): In unified-plan mode, disable the low resolution streams for low fps SS. In unified plan impl, it is not possible to enable/disable simulcast during the call since the same sender is re-used for all local video tracks. Therefore, disable the low resolution simulcast streams for low fps screensharing so that the bridge forwards only the highest resolution stream which is important for low fps screensharing.
		- fix(JingleSessionPC): Do not check if the ssrc already exists in the RD when adding a ssrc-group from source-add.
		- fix(VADAudioAnalyser): NPE error evaluating this._vadEmitter.on (#1652)
		- fix(TPC): Do not remove ssrcs from remote desc for p2p. In unified plan, re-use of m-line (i.e., adding an SSRC, removing it and then adding it back) causes the browser to not render the media on Chrome and Safari. The WebRTC spec is not clear as to how browsers have to behave, this doesn't cause any issues on Firefox. As a workaround, only change the media direction and leave the ssrc in the remote desc. This automatically triggers a 'removetrack' event on the associated MediaStream and the track can be removed from the UI.
		- fix(VAD): Do not enable VAD on Chrome on iOS.
		- fix(RTC): Do not overwrite other constraints when resolution option is used. When the resolution option was being used, all the other constraints like frameRate and facing mode were being overwritten.
		- Send videoType bridge message for mute/unmute on FF. (#1642)
		- fix(TPC): Filter ssrcs differently while extracting the SSRC map from SDP. Use 'msid' for plan-b clients and 'cname' for unified-plan clients.
		- fix(TPC): fix local resolution/fps stats. Browsers do not generate a 'msid' attribute for ssrcs in unified plan mode, use mediaType as a key for the TrackSSRCInfo map.
		- fix(recording): Send participant id when recording starts/stops (#1632)
		- fix(connectivity): Fix video freezes on Safari when ep goes out of last-n.

##  2.0.5963 (2021-06-10)
- [jitsi-meet 1.0.5056](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/releases/tag/stable%2Fjitsi-meet_5963)

	lib-jitsi-meet
	- New features:
		- feat(TPC): Enable unified-plan support for Chromium based browsers. This can be controlled through the config.js  option 'enableUnifiedOnChrome'.
		- Audio/Video moderation. (#1581)

	- Fixes:
		- fix(RTC): Adjust the media direction for p2p conn. For p2p connections, the media direction needs to be adjusted after every source-add/source-remove is processed based on the availability of local sources.
		- fix(RTC): Use a enum for media direction.
		- fix(JingleSessionPC): Disable unified-plan for p2p. Disable cross browser p2p using unified plan until all the issues are fixed.
		- fix(moderation): Unmuting after av moderation and no track.
		- fix(moderation): Fixes detecting av moderation approved.
		- fix(Sdp): Fix maxaveragebitrate typo
		- fix(LocalSdpMunger): Fix unit test.
		- fix(CodecSelection): Call RTCRtpTransceiver#setCodecPreferences before renegotiation. Call RTCRtpTransceiver#setCodecPreferences with the preferrred codec order before every createOffer/createAnswer. This ensures that the codec preference is enforced even when there is no local description available yet while the preferred codec is being set immediately after media session creation.
		- fix(JingleSessionPC): Add a workaround for chrome issue. The 'signalingstatechange' event for 'stable' is fired after the 'iceconnectionstatechange' event for 'completed' is fired on chrome in Unified plan. This prevents the client from switching the media connection to the p2p connection once the ice connection for p2p gets established.
		- fix(Logging): Log enhancements. Add a preifx to logs for idenitifying the type of TPC/jingleSessionPC.
		- fix(TPC): Do not configure encodings on Safari until reneg. Avoid configuring the encodings on Chromium/Safari until simulcast is configured for the newly added track using SDP munging which happens during the renegotiation.
		- fix(TPC): Do not configure encodings on chromium immediately after replace track. Avoid configuring the encodings on chromium immediately after replace track since the encoding params are read-only until the renegotation is done.
		- send json message (#1180)
		- fix(SDP): Add missing msid for p2p sources.
		- fix(TPC): Don't convert plan-b<->unified-plan SDPs for p2p.
		- fix(JingleSessionPC): Do not try to re-use inactive mid for new remote ssrcs. The direction was marked as 'inactive' only on Firefox as Safari had audio issues when an inactive mid is re-used. Chrome (in unified-plan) needs the direction of the mid in remote desc to be set to 'inactive' for a 'removetrack' to be fired on the associated media stream whenever a remote source is removed.
		- fix(SDP): Drop SSRCs whenever the transceiver direction is 'inactive' or 'recvonly'. This is needed only for JVB connections. Add unit tests for LocalSdpMunger.
		- Ignore startAudioMuted/startVideoMuted for p2p. The tracks will not be added when the call switches from jvb to p2p for an endpoint that joins muted by focus.
		- fix(RTC): Do not suppress the source updates on Firefox. If the msid attribute is missing, then remove the ssrc from the transformed description so that a source-remove is signaled to Jicofo. This happens when the direction of the transceiver (or m-line) is set to 'inactive' or 'recvonly' on Firefox. Not signaling these source updates creates issues with remote track handling on the other endpoints in the call.
		- fix(RTC): Set transceiver direction after RTCRtpSender#replaceTrack. This fixes the issue where TRACK_REMOVED event is not fired when a remote track is removed from the peerconnection. Fixes https://github.com/jitsi/lib-jitsi-meet/issues/1612 and https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/8482.
		- fix(caps): Disable TCC on Firefox. There is a known issue with Firefox where the BWE gets halved on every renegotiation causing the low upload bitrates from the Firefox clients.
		- Drops unused config, fixes jitsi/lib-jitsi-meet#1620.
		- fix(e2ee): destroys olm session on disabling e2ee
		- fix(RTC): Disable simulcast for SS when using H.264. Fixes https://github.com/jitsi/docker-jitsi-meet/issues/1048
		- fix(TPC): Return default codec if the local sdp is not available. Get the correct media type when generating the source identifier.
		- fix(vad): enable VAD on supported browsers (#1613)
		- fix(JingleSession): Move the ssrc identifier generation to LocalSdpMunger.
		- fix(logger): Logging enhancements. Get rid of noisy logs related to SDP transformations which are redundant. Fix formatting and add missing information.
		- fix(quality-control): Propagate the height constraints to p2p session. If the application is using the new receiver constraints, propagate the height constraint to the p2p session as well.
		- fix(quality-control): fix constraints sent on channel initialization. Do not send old format constraints if no constraints are set before the channel is initialized.

		- sysMessageHandler not deleted (#1590)
		- fix(quality-control): Send the new constraint on join. Fixes the case where the old format height constraint is sent on join for a jvb media session.
		- fix(quality-control): Switch to new receiver constraints by default. Use the new receiver constraints unless it is explicitly disabled through config.js.
		- Drops the sys message handler after used or connected.
		- fix(RTC): Specify default width of 1280px for video. Fixes https://github.com/jitsi/lib-jitsi-meet/issues/1571.

	- Translation updates:
		- Update korean translation (#8879)
		- Update main-da.json (#8642)


	lib-jitsi-meet
	- New features:
		- feat(RTC): Signal video type and availability to bridge.
		- feat(stats): Add a new bridge message "EndpointStats" for stats. Use the new Colibri message "EndpointStats" for broadcasting the local stats. The bridge then will be able to filter the endpoint stats and send them only to the interested parties instead of broadcasting it to all the endpoints in the call.
		- feat(e2ee): makes olm sessions initialisation lazy
		- feat(e2ee) update to SFrame draft -02
		- feat(stats): Get audio levels for the top 5 speakers only.
		- Consider absence of A/V muted from presence as muted.
		- Moderator can revoke moderator role to others and himself (#1532)
		- participant kick reason add
		- feat(jwtError): Send explicit error on auth failed with invalid jwt
		- Remove ssrcs on leave
		- feat(ReceiveVideoController): Add the ability to send constraints in the new format. Add the ability to send the bridge messages for the receiver video constraints in the new format directly.
		- feat(dominantSpeaker): Add previous speaker list.
		- feat(browser-support): Add support for WKWebview based browsers. Apple added getUserMedia support for WkWebview based browsers like chrome and Firefox on iOS 14.3. These browsers behave as Safari does on iOS. Therefore, extend the Safari checks to these webkit based browsers as well.
		- Added mute video moderation feature (#1496)
		- Use the new bridge signaling format.
		- Reuse billingId from localstorage as jitsiMeetId.
		- feat(docs) mvoe API documentatrion to the handbook
		- feat(GUM): timeout.
		- Send billing id to prosody on join presence
		- Add the ability to configure max. bitrates for VP9. The max bitrate for VP9 is enforced by adding the b=AS:<limit> line in the SDP since there is no way to configure the max. bitrates for the individual SVC streams using RTCRtpSender.setParameters.
		- expose MEETING_ID_SET event (#1484)
		- Adds option to set ws keepalive url through config.
		- Implement aggresive layer suspension on RN. RN doesn't support RTCRtpSender yet. Therefore, media is suspended on RN by changing the media direction in the SDP whenever the client receives an ideal height of 0 for sender constraints on the bridge channel.
		- Support the urn:xmpp:extdisco:2 namespace specified by XEP-0215 (#1472)
		- Changes ws default keepalive interval.
		- Detects shard changed when using websockets. (#1462)
		- Add codec selection mechanism. Determine the preferred codec for a given endpoint based on the config.js settings and the codecs supported by the endpoint. The preferred codec is published in presence and then used by the other endpoints in the call during join/leave to determine if the codec needs to be changed on the fly. Different codecs can be configuered for p2p/jvb connections. The preferredCodec/disabledCodec settings under videoQuality will have precedence over the older settins like preferH264/disableH264.

	- Fixes:
		- fix(rtc) Fix setting effects while not in a conference.
		- Fixes error for undefined error, on happening on p2p kick.
		- fix(receiveVideoController): Do a deep copy of constraints for comparsion.
		- fix(codec-selection): Fix codec selection for unified plan browsers.
		- fix(receiveVideoController): Do not send redundant video constraints to the bridge.
		- fix(e2ee) update docs after dropping signatures
		- Dial-out after setting password in the meeting.
		- fix(caps): features update event is not emitted.
		- fix(TPC): get ssrc info per ssrc and not per mline.
		- fix(JingleSession): Avoid renegotiation when user with no sources leaves the call.
		- fix(deps) update webrtc-adapter to v7.7.1
		- fix(screenshare): audio screen share muted state
		- fix(modificationQueue): error handling & logs
		- fix(lastN): Return the correct lastN value for the conference.
		- fix(conference): Do not signal muted tracks on join. Do not add the muted audio/video tracks to the peerconnection on join. The tracks will be added when the user unmutes for the first time. This reduces the number of remote sources that will be added when a participant joins a large call where everyone joins muted (startAudioMuted/startVideoMuted setting).
		- Checks presence editing and make sure we send only on change.
		- fix(RTCUtils): Init availableDevices.
		- fix(RTC) fix device selection not being available
		- fix(TPCUtils): undefined is not an object (evaluating 'this.tpcUtils.replaceTrack(e,t).then')
		- fix(TPC): Remove the existing track instead of overwriting. When a second remote track of the same mediatype is received for an endpoint, remove the existing track before creating the new remote track.
		- fix(e2ee) fix disabling E2EE
		- fix(e2ee) fix key index after ratchetting
		- Drop caps handling (#1495)
		- fix(SendVideoController): Apply the sender constraint only when it changes. There were cases where the bridge was sending the same constraint multiple times causing redundant calls to getParameters/setParameters on the RTCRtpSender.
		- fix(gum) update permissions prompt detection
		- Save guards _features to be always empty and nver undefined. (#1493)
		- fix(GUM-permissions): cache permissions on init.
		- fix(example) simplify
		- fix(GUM): improve permissions logic.
		- fix(ice-restart): Force client reloads when call is migrated.
		- VADAudioAnalyser: catch error
		- Restore local connection status. After ICE failure and subsequent recovery of the media connection to the bridge using session-terminate, the local connection status needs to updated when ICE connection is established on the new peerconnection. The local connectivity status will be shown as Lost otherwise.
		- return default codec if local desc is not available. Fixes https://github.com/jitsi/lib-jitsi-meet/issues/1466

		- fix(avatar) revert back to defaulting to Gravatar
		- fix(lastN): select screenshare endpoint always when auto pinning. When trying to auto pin screenshare, always select the endpoint even though it happens to be the large video participant in redux. The auto pin screenshare logic kicks in after the track is added.  If the screenshare endpoint is not among the forwarded endpoints from the bridge, it needs to be selected again.
		- fix(lastN): Do not override channelLastN value. If limitLastN values are specified and channelLastN < limitLastN, configure channelLastN on the conference.
		- Fixes 404 page link when base is used.

		- fix(safari): Ensure simulcast stream resolutions don't change. Safari 14.1 has a bug where it returns 720p for every simulcast stream when RTCRtpSender.getParameters is called even though the stream resolutions are different. By using the encodings config used when source was added, on every RTCRtpSender.setParameters call, we ensure that simulcast stream resolutions don't change. chore(deps) lib-jitsi-meet@latest

		- fix(CalendarList): calendar.svg path.
		- fix(screenshare): Fixes for the blurry desktop share issues. Do not resize the desktop share to 720p by default when the desktop track resolution is higher than 720p. This is causing bluriness when presenter is turned on. Remove the 'detail' contentHint setting for the desktop+presenter canvas stream as it forcing chrome to send only 5 fps stream for high resolution desktop tracks. Move the desktop resizing logic behind a config.js option - videoQuality.resizeDesktopForPresenter.

		- fix(video-quality): set lastN to 1 when screenshare is added to call in audio-only mode. This fixes an issue where lastN is not bumped to 1 on an audio-only client when a screenshare source is added to the call.
		- fix(deviceChange):Dont create video track if muted
		- fix(conference): start muted values on initial GUM
		- fix(iFrame): capturScreenshot - check if the remote participant has a track attached. Participants that join video muted do not have video tracks attached. Fixes https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/7942.

		- fix(pwa) bypass loading in electron. ensure same origin with registrator
		- fix(UI): Do not re-compute the container width when chat window is closed. Since the external API now sets preferredWidth/preferredHeight for resizing the large video, we don't need to add chat width to the computed window width when the chat window is closed. Fixes https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/7889
		- fix(pwa) improve upon pwa specs
		- fix(avatars) refactor preloading

		- update French translation (#7725)
		- * languages-ka.json
		- Update Arabic translation
		- * lang:New translation malayalam(ml-in)


	lib-jitsi-meet
	- New features:
		- Skip p2p when the participant is jigasi.
		- feat(stats) migrate RN to new stats
		- Add option to force pc to use turn relay candidates.
		- Remove the min-participants config. (#1418)
		- Log the jvb version. (#1410)
		- feat(BrowserCapabilities) drop supportsVideo
		- feat(RTC) bump minimum supported Chromium version to 72
		- Reduce pings and adds xmpp ping config (#1389)
		- feat(rn) support getDisplayMedia
		- feat(twa) add TWA check function
		- feat(e2ee) log Olm version

	- Fixes:
		- fix(stats) fix parsing codec in new stats
		- Skip sending multiple times disco-info to jicofo.
		- Maybe start p2p only when we have received all presences.
		- Implement the encodings workaround only on Safari. Explicitly check if all the encodings report the same scaleResolutionDownBy value before trying to ensure they match the expected values. This makes Chrome VP9 work again.
		- Fixes ping options usage.
		- fix(XMPP): Get the correct domain for XMPP ping.
		- Updates ping logic around detecting xmpp activity.
		- add `getParticipants` to JitsiConference docs
		- Always query the main domain for features. Fixes jitsi/jitsi-meet#8173 (#1428)
		- fix(TPC): Do not scale down desktop track in p2p mdoe.
		- fix(deps) update logger to 1.0.0
		- fix(last-n): Do not let Jicofo initialize last-n for the whole conference. The plan is to move the lastNLimits logic to bridge. The clients will be able to override(lower) the bridge limits through the bridge channel only. Also, this lets us configure last-n per receiver and not set the last-n value for the whole conference the way Jicofo sets it currently.
		- fix(TPC): do not update encodings for simulcast desktop tracks. Fixes https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/8094.
		- typos
		- typos on comments
		- fix(TPC): Do not update encodings for non-simulcast sources.
		- fix(TPC): Ensure encodings resolutions match configured values. On every call to RTCRtpSender.setParameters(), ensure that the resolution configured for the encoding matches that of the value configured on the RTCRtpSender when the source was added to the peerconnection. This should prevent us from overriding the default values if the browser returns erroneous values when RTCRtpSender.getParameters is used for getting the encodings info. This fixes the issue on recent versions of Safari where the 'scaleResolutionDownBy' value comes back as 1 for all encodings even though the encoding resolution is different from the stream capture resolution.
		- fix(video-quality): Fix p2p desktop share quality. In p2p mode, 'scaleResolutionDownBy' is used for downscaling a stream when needed, i.e. when the user receives a receive constraint of 360p because the other participant is in tile view. When desktop share is started, the encoding config has to be scaled back up so that the other participant starts receiving HD resolution for the share as desktop shares are autopinned. Therefore, encodings have to enabled/disabled for desktop shares as well. Earlier it was done only for camera tracks.
		- fix(stun) update default list of STUN servers
		- fix(rn) release audioVideo stream after creating new MediaStream
		- fix(audio-recorder) remove no longer needed code
		- fix(RTC): Fix log formatting
		- fix(video-quality): do not disable encodings when sender constraints are not configured on the conference. Fixes https://github.com/jitsi/lib-jitsi-meet/issues/1333 in applications that use lib-jitsi-meet and do not have layer suspension enabled.
		- Add the x-google-conference flag on RD when screensharing. Add the conference flag back since the bridge is able to handle the case where more than 1 temporal layers are received even when only 1 ssrc is signaled.
		- fix(xmpp): Update previd value when trying to resume connection.
		- fix(JingleSession) log initialization error

		- Announce version in ServerHello (optionally). (#1528)
		- Add oversending time stat (#1514)

		- fix(native) add missing function
		- Show focus indicator only when navigating via keyboard
		- fix(video-quality): Add the ability to request Ultra HD resolutions Change the preferredVideoQuality and maxReceiverVideoQuality values to Ultra HD resolutions. The requested resolution can be as high as 4K to facilitate VPaaS customers to request 4K. The sender video resolution will always max out at the value specified in the video constraints from config.js settings.
		- fix(misc) update update-ljm script commit message
		- fix(config) drop useStunTurn
		- fix(android) - separates the invocation of the gradle tasks. It was noticed on some configurations that the publish task was executed before assembleRelease finished
		- fix(android) - adds the import for the VersionName, since on some configurations it is not automatically imported

		- fix(lang) add basic support for serbian
		- fix(rn,config) increase config load timeout to 10 seconds

		- fix(TPC): maxBitratesVideo break screenshare
		- fix(e2ee) add more documentation
		- fix(updateDevices): On enumerateDevices.
		- fix(audio-levels): Reset audio level to 0 when remote user is muted. When using getSynchornizationSources on the audio receiver to gather audio levels for remote tracks, browser reports last known audio levels even when the remote user is audio muted, we need to reset the value to zero here so that the audio levels are cleared.
		- fix(safari): Remove old remote tracks when a new track is received for an endpoint. On Safari, MediaStream.onremovetrack is not fired when a remote desciption with a removed MSID is applied. As a result, new remote tracks for the same endpoint are not created causing issues where the video is not updated on Safari. Also, make sure local tracks on pc are updated when devices are changed while the user is in muted state.
		- Disable RTX on Firefox. Disable RTX on FF as we are seeing video freezes on FF80 and later - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1668028

	- Fixes:
		- Fixes setting non moderators to members when lobby is enabled.
		- fix(video-quality): add missing simulcast stream constraints When the client starts video muted and the track is later added, make sure we construct the simulcasr stream constraints then.
		- fix(video-quality): Get downsampled video for p2p case When the video sender constraint changes in the p2p case when the remote user switches between stage/tile view, get a downsampled video of the original 720p stream instead of requesting the camera for a new stream with the lower resolution.

		- Fix unit tests for PerformanceObserverStats

Values reported by getStats on chrome do not follow the the spec and since we have combination of clients using both getStats and getSynchronizationSources, lets stick to one scale to make them look uniform. Also, the receivers seem to be reporting audio level for a little bit after the remote user has muted. Make sure the track is unmuted before setting the audio level on the track.
